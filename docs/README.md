# BitChat Core (Placeholder)

This directory is intended to house the core BitChat source code, which is primarily written in Swift for iOS and macOS. For the purpose of Cerberus v0.3 development, this would involve cloning the official BitChat repository (https://github.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat) and integrating it here.

Further development in this directory would involve:

*   Adapting BitChat for drone-specific environments.
*   Performing security audits and hardening.
*   Integrating with the Cerberus communication manager via defined APIs.

**Note:** The actual BitChat source code is not included in this repository. This serves as a conceptual placeholder for where it would reside within the Cerberus v0.3 project structure.
